                                    surely need to have collection of 10,000 unique NFTs themselves. 
                                    And then we’re starting to build a whole universe behind it with
                                    which you’ll be able to interact. Also, there can’t be any great 
                                    project without a great community, and we know it too! You can
                                    already go to our Discord Server and find people like you with

                                    However, to get unlimited access to our store and more, you’ll

                                    as well as will also help us to make more giveaways and 
                                    airdrops. We’re also planning to create our own Spotify Radio
                                    and YouTube translation with Lo-Fi Beats.</p>

                                <p>In our plans, we’re thinking about creating our own Token or 
                                    even a whole NFT Marketplace that will help you to buy NFTs 
                                    there rather than from Opensea.io. You’ll also be able to use 
                                    our Token to buy NFTs and probably spend it in our future 
                                    Multiverse too! Anyway, Cryprotoken is a great example of 
                                    Web 3.0 and will make everything much easier, and that is 
                                    our goal #1</p>

                                    of this we’ll be able to create and publish our own comics or
